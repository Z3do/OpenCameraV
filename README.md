Hello, **before you start to clarify that I am not the author of this mod**. I just share the update I made.
This mod will be updated as soon as a new gamebuild is released. 
This version is available from *GameBuild* **1604** to **3095**. 
                                                                    
## How to:

1. Download [OpenCameraV](https://github.com/Z3do/OpenCameraV/releases)

2. Locate your `FiveM Application Data` folder

4. Create a `plugins` folder inside the `FiveM Application Data` folder, if you havenâ€™t got one already.

5. Extract the `openCameraV.asi` file in to the `plugins` folder
