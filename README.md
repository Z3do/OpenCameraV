Hello, **before you start to clarify that I am not the author of this mod**. I just share the update I made.
This mod will be updated as soon as a new gamebuild is released. 
This version is available from *GameBuild* **1604** to **3407**. 

⚠️ During my tests I only use OpenCameraV as mods so if you have problems making OpenCameraV work with other mods do not hesitate to ask for help directly on the FiveM topic [OpenCameraV](https://forum.cfx.re/t/opencamerav-gamebuilds-1604-to-3258/5146852)
